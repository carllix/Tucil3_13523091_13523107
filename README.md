## Description
This project is a solution to Tucil 3 of IF2211 - Strategy and Algorithm, Semester II 2024/2025. The program aims to solve the classic Rush Hour puzzle using various pathfinding algorithms, including Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best First Search (GBFS), A*, and Beam Search.

The puzzle is loaded from a configuration file, and the program computes a sequence of moves to help the red car (or the designated goal vehicle) reach the exit. For informed search algorithms (GBFS, A*, Beam Search), the program provides two heuristic options: Manhattan Distance and Blocking Heuristic. These heuristics guide the search process to efficiently find a solution with fewer explored nodes.

The application includes two modes of operation:
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**, for a text-based interaction and output.
![CLI](doc/img/cli.png)
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, built with JavaFX, which offers visual puzzle representation, animated step-by-step solutions, and real-time performance statistics.

- **src** : contains the program's source code in .java files.
- **build** : ontains the compiled .jar files for both the CLI and GUI versions, ready to be executed.
- **test** : contains the testing results included in the assignment report.
- **doc** : contains the assignment report and program documentation.

## Requirements & Installation
Before running the program, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carllix/Tucil3_13523091_13523107.git
    cd Tucil3_13523091_13523107
    ```
2. Make sure the following are installed on your system:
    - Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or above
    - JavaFX SDK 17 or above (only required for running the .jar GUI version)

> ðŸ’¡ JavaFX SDK can be downloaded from: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

> âœ… If you use the self-contained executable package (generated using jpackage), you do not need to install Java or JavaFX manually.

## How to Use
There are three ways to run the program: CLI, GUI via `.jar`, and GUI via self-contained package.
- **Run via Command Line Interface (CLI)**
  ```bash
  java -jar build/RushHourSolverCLI.jar
  ```
  This will launch a text-based interface where you can select a puzzle file, choose an algorithm, and view the solution and statistics directly in the terminal.

- **Run via Graphical User Interface (GUI - JAR)**
  ```bash
  java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar build/RushHourSolver.jar
  ```
  Replace `/path/to/javafx-sdk/lib` with the actual path to your JavaFX SDKâ€™s `lib` folder.
  This will open the GUI where you can interactively load puzzles, choose algorithms and heuristics, and watch the animated solution.

- **Run via GUI Self-Contained Executable Package**

  In the root of this repository, you will find a  `RushHourSolver.zip` file generated using jpackage.
  1. Extract the `.zip` file
  2. Navigate to the extracted folder
  3. Double-click the executable file (`RushHourSolver.exe`)
  > This package is self-contained, meaning it includes its own Java runtime and JavaFX dependencies. No additional installation is required.
